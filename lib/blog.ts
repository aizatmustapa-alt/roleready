          "Why am I not getting interviews despite having relevant experience? The most common reasons are a generic resume that isn't tailored to the specific role, weak achievement statements that describe tasks rather than results, or applying without enough research into the company and role. In a competitive market, relevant experience alone isn't enough. You need to communicate that experience clearly and compellingly.",
          "Do ATS systems automatically reject my resume? ATS systems can filter resumes based on keywords, but they're not the only reason applications fail. Ensure your resume uses language from the job description, avoid complex formatting like tables or text boxes, and focus equally on making your resume readable and persuasive for the human reviewer who sees it next.",
          "How important is it to tailor my resume for each job application in Australia? Very important. The Australian job market is currently highly competitive across white-collar sectors, and recruiters can tell immediately when a resume is generic. Even small adjustments can significantly improve your application's performance.",
          "How many jobs should I be applying for each week? More is not always better. A focused search of 8-15 well-matched, tailored applications typically outperforms 40-50 generic ones. Track your response rate and adjust accordingly.",
          "What should I track when managing my job applications? At minimum: the role title, company name, date applied, version of resume used and current status. Ideally, also note contact names, follow-up dates and any feedback received.",
